Slate is here to bridge the language gap across the globe! Slate provides the ability to have fluent and seamless text conversations with anyone, speaking any language. Whether it is talking with a potential business partner that only speaks Spanish, introducing yourself to the French foreign exchange student, catching up with the Italian friend you met on your vacation last summer, and so many more situations. The possibilities are endless!

Slate uses Firebase to store and send text, photo, video & audio messages. Then uses the Google Translate API to translate these messages to the user's specified language.
